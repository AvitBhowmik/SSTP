## SSTP ##

Spatially Shifting Temporal Points (SSTP) is an alternative pooled within-time series (e.g. years) variogram estimation tool. This is particularly useful for spatially data-scarce regions, where abundant time series are available. For example,  climate databases in developing countries are generally spatially scarce, i.e. only a few (< 50) meteorological stations data, but abundant in time, i.e. long (> 50 years) time series are available. A temporally constant spatial variogram can be estimated using SSTP that outperforms the erratic spatial variogram estimation for individual years and the available pooled within-time series variogram estimation technique.

## Instructions for usage ##

You should have the latest version of R and the required packages installed as demonstrated in the "SSTP_script.R". Download the "SSTP_data.Rdata" and "SSTP_script.R" and follow the instructions in the script.
